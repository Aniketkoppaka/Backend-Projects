  <h1>Secrets</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Write down one good thing that happened to you every day. It can change how you view your life over time.</li>
    <li>When you're nervous before a presentation, imagine you're explaining something cool to a friend, not performing for strangers.</li>
    <li>Learn to cook one dish really well. It builds confidence and makes you memorable at gatherings.</li>
    <li>Keep a digital folder of compliments you receive. Revisit it on tough days to remind yourself of your worth.</li>
    <li>Stretch for five minutes after waking up and before bed. It improves your posture, sleep, and energy.</li>
    <li>If you're feeling overwhelmed, clean a small part of your room. Order in your space can bring clarity to your mind.</li>
  </ul>
